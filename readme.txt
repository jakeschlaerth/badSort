when run as a python3 script, this program (badSort.py) will prompt the user to input a decimal value as the alpha parameter
of an implementation of badSort, a version of the stooge sort algorithm. It will search in its local directory
for a file called "data.txt",  a file where the first value of each line is the number of integers
that need to be sorted, followed by the integers.
This program will sort those integers and write the results to a file called bad.out.
